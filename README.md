### Welcome to Abram's repository!
This is my repository!  
I'll be putting all my classwork here.  

### Here's a bit about me!  
> I'm a Junior here at South, with plans to major in Computer Science with a focus on AI, and a minor in Russian and math. I'm from the New Orleans area, and I've been living there all my life.
