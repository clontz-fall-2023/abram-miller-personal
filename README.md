### Welcome to Abram's repository!
This is my repository!  
I'll be putting all my classwork here.  

### Here's a bit about me!  
> I'm a Junior here at South. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a focus on AI, and minoring in Russian and math. I'm from the New Orleans area, and I've been living there all my life. In my free time I usually play games with my friends, such as Destiny 2, Minecraft, Terraria, or Risk of Rain 2.  

### Here are some pictures of my cats!  
This is Russell, aka Kitkit:
